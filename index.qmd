## Using R to Build a Community Data Explorer for Cincinnati (CoDEC)

1. Introduction to CoDEC
1. Sharing CoDEC Data
1. Exploring CoDEC Data

# Background

## The White House's Equitable Data Working Group^[<https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-recommendations-for-advancing-use-of-equitable-data/>]:

- Equitable data are "those that allow for rigorous assessment of the extent to which government programs and policies yield consistently fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals."
- Equitable data should ‚Äúilluminate opportunities for targeted actions that will result in demonstrably improved outcomes for underserved communities.‚Äù
- Make disaggregated data the norm while being "... intentional about when data are collected and shared, as well as how data are protected so as not to exacerbate the vulnerability of members of underserved communities, many of whom face the heightened risk of harm if their privacy is not protected."

## Disaggregation

- Open data can fall short of driving action if it is not equitable.

- Disaggregating^[[Kader F, Doan LN, Lee M, Chin MK, Kwon SC, Yi SS. Disaggregating race/ethnicity data categories: Criticisms, dangers, and opposing viewpoints.](https://doi.org/10.1377/forefront.20220323.555023)] data by sensitive attributes, like race and ethnicity, can elucidate inequities that would otherwise remain hidden.

> Open data is necessary and **not** sufficient to drive the type of action that we need to create a more equitable society.

--- The U.S. Chief Data Scientist, Denice Ross^[<https://www.fedscoop.com/us-chief-data-scientist-interview/>]

## Privacy

- Data are people^[[Zook M, Barocas S, Boyd D, Crawford K, Keller E, Gangadharan SP, Goodman A, Hollander R, Koenig BA, Metcalf J, Narayanan A. Ten simple rules for responsible big data research. PLoS computational biology. 2017 Mar 30;13(3):e1005399.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005399)]
- Privacy is a spectrum of the tradeoffs between risks and benefits to individuals and populations
- Data collected at the individual-level by one organization often cannot be shared^[<https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/protecting-participant-privacy-when-sharing-scientific-data/principles-and-best-practices-for-protecting-participant-privacy>] with another organization due to legal restrictions or organization-specific data governance policies
- Community-level (e.g.¬†neighborhood, census tract, ZIP code) data disaggregated by gender, race, or other sensitive attributes
- Achieving data harmonization upstream of storage allows for contribution of disaggregated, community-level data without disclosing individual-level data when sharing across organizations

## The TRUST principles for digital repositories^[[Lin D, Crabtree J, Dillo I, Downs RR, Edmunds R, Giaretta D, De Giusti M, L‚ÄôHours H, Hugo W, Jenkyns R, Khodiyar V. The TRUST Principles for digital repositories. Scientific Data. 2020 May 14;7(1):144.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0486-7)]

Creating and maintaining an open community-level data resource equips the entire community for data-powered decision making *and* boosts organizational trustworthiness. Demonstrating reliability and capability of appropriately managing shared data helps earn the trust of organizations and communities intended to be served:

- ü§≤ **transparent**: make specific repository services and data holdings verifiable by publicly accessible evidence
- üìÉ **responsible**: ensure authenticity and integrity of data holdings
- üë• **user-focused**: meet data management norms and expectations of target user communities
- ‚è≥Ô∏èÔ∏è **sustainable**: preserve services and data holdings for the long-term
- ‚öôÔ∏è **technological**: provide infrastructure and capabilities supporting secure, persistent, and reliable services


## FAIR^[<https://data.org/resources/the-fair-data-principles/>]

- üîé **findable**: use a unique and persistent identifier, add rich metadata (using existing standards^[<https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/>])
- üîì **accessible**: store in a data repository (‚ö†Ô∏è personal/classified information, but metadata still accessible)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **interoperable**: use an open file format with controlled vocabularies, reference relevant datasets
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **reusable**: well documented, including a description (README with data sources, background, and how to reproduce the data), a data dictionary (field descriptions, units, titles, missingness), and usage licenses (for code^[<https://choosealicense.com/licenses/>] or data/presentations/papers^[<https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/>]) 

## **Co**mmunity **D**ata **E**xplorer for **C**incinnati (**CoDEC**)

A data repository composed of equitable, community-level data for Cincinnati.

## CoDEC Aims

::: {.incremental}

1. Define common data specification for community-level data considering FAIR, TRUST, privacy, equitable disaggregation
1. Create and disseminate methods and tools for harmonizing, storing, accessing, and *sharing* community-level data, including spatiotemporal harmonization and interpolation tools, checks to contribute aggregate, API for accessing data at scale and on demand
1. Serve a portable interactive data catalog derived on demand from metadata and an open API to link to or include with other data catalogs (e.g., C2D2)
1. Create an interactive web application to explore community-level distributions across Cincinnati and explore simple relationships between community-level measures

## Data Harmonization

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}
[CoDEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec) encodes data streams about the communities in which we live into a common format (census tract and month) so that it can be decoded into different community-level geographies and different time frames.

# Sharing CoDEC Data

## Frictionless Standards

Developed by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/), the frictionless^[<https://frictionlessdata.io/>] [standards](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) are a set of patterns for describing data, including datasets (Data Package), files (Data Resource), and tables (Table Schema). A Data Package is a simple container format used to describe and package a collection of data and metadata, including schemas. These metadata are contained in a specific file (separate from the data file), usually written in JSON or YAML, that describes something specific to each Frictionless Standard:

- [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/): describes a tabular file by providing its dimension, field data types, relations, and constraints
- [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/): describes an *exact* tabular file providing a path to the file and details like title, description, and others
- [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) = Data Resource + Table Schema
- [CSV dialect](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/): describes the formatting specific to the various dialects of CSV files
- [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) & [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/): describes a *collection* of tabular files providing data resource information from above along with general information about the package itself, a license, authors, and other metadata

## {cincy}

CoDEC relies on the {[cincy](https://geomarker.io/cincy/index.html)} R package to define Cincinnati-area [geographies](https://geomarker.io/cincy/articles/geographies.html) and [interpolate](https://geomarker.io/cincy/articles/interpolate.html) area-level data between census tracts, neighborhoods, and ZIP codes in different years.

- [Avondale Case Study](https://geomarker.io/cincy/articles/avondale.html)

- [County Groupings](https://geomarker.io/cincy/articles/counties.html)

## The `codec` R package supports [CoDEC](https://geomarker.io/codec) data infrastructure through:

# Exploring CoDEC

## Screenshot

![](figs/codec_explorer_screenshot.png){fig-align="center"}

## Shiny

- {[shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)} is a powerful tool for developing reactive, interactive web applications

- Here, we use Shiny to create a data explorer for CoDEC

- With Shiny the user has the power to explore the data of their choosing and visually see the link across data displays

## Leveraging data standards for Shiny

- Rather than a static data source (such as a .rds file), with each initialization of the app, the user is actually performing a fresh "pull" from CoDEC

- As CoDEC updates, the explorer updates 

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: true

d_drive <- codec::codec_data("hamilton_drivetime") 

drive_meta <- codec::glimpse_schema(d_drive)

#...

```


## Inset panel and scatterplot

- The core pieces of the app are a {[leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)} interactive map and an inset scatterplot made using {[ggiraph](https://www.ardata.fr/ggiraph-book/)} and {[cowplot](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/plot_grid.html)}

- Inspired by and leveraging the {[biscale](https://chris-prener.github.io/biscale/)} package, the explorer visualizes bivariate relationships using a blended color scale
  - The scatterplot background is divided into the 9 levels between both variables and doubles as a color legend
  - Both axes contain histograms displaying the univariate distribution of each selected metric
  - When hovering over a point on the plot, the corresponding histogram indicators are highlighted
  
- By using the function `shiny::absolutepanel()`, we can overlay a plotting panel on top of the map and escape the gridded layout that many Shiny apps default to

## {[bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/)} layout

- The explorer is built using the {bslib} package, which fully implements the latest Bootstrap 5 components
    - "fillable" pages/containers that naturally fill the user's window
    - Modern cards and sidebars 

- Using only a couple lines of code, we can easily match the theme of the app to the CoDEC website

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

ui <- bslib::page_fillable(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(version = 5,
                   "bg" = "#FFFFFF",
                   "fg" = "#396175",
                   "primary" = "#C28273",
                   "grid-gutter-width" = "0.0rem",
                   "border-radius" = "0.5rem",
                   "btn-border-radius" = "0.25rem")
  
  #...
)

```


## Connecting data displays and metadata

- In order to connect the selected inputs to the plotting portions, we implemented a series of reactive "crosstalk" connections
    - We take advantage of the CoDEC metadata to display user-friendly variable titles while linking to R-friendly variable names
    - CoDEC metadata is also crucial for connecting individual metrics to the data core that they are a part of
- The explorer also takes advantage of Shiny reactivity by allowing the user to select a tract on the map and highlight it on the scatterplot, as well as the opposite direction
    - Both {leaflet} and {ggiraph} export user-selected objects that can be shared across the app
